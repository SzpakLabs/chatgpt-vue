## Quick Start

Before getting started, make sure you have Node.js runtime environment installed correctly. If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can [click here to download](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/).

To use ChatGPT, you need to apply for an API Key. If you have registered but don't have an API Key yet, you can [go here to generate one](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once you're ready, navigate to the project root directory and run the following command to start the project:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

When the project runs successfully, it usually displays (specifics may vary):

```bash
VITE v3.2.5  ready in 294 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Hold down `Ctrl` or `command` and click the Local link to open the project in your browser. Then, enter your API Key in the input box at the bottom of the page and click Save to start using it!

If you want to change the API Key, click the Settings button in the top right corner of the page, re-enter it, and save.

If you want to package and run it locally, [check here](/docs/electron-packaging-guide.md)。

I hope this helps you. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask in the comments. Thank you!
